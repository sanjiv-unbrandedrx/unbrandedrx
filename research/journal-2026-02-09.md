## Entry 1 — Hims Weight Management Quiz Flow Analysis

**It's a CATEGORY quiz** — not product-specific. The URL path is `hims.com/g/i/wm/` (weight management). It has **two distinct phases**:

### Phase 1: Marketing Funnel (Pre-Account) — ~7 steps
These happen on `hims.com/g/i/wm/` before any account creation:

| # | URL slug | Question | Type | Purpose |
|---|----------|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | `/your-goal` | What's your weight loss goal? | Single select (1-15 lbs, 16-50, 51+, maintain, not sure) | Segmentation |
| 2 | `/no-judgement` | "83% of Americans are not the weight they'd like to be" | Social proof interstitial | Engagement |
| 3 | `/treatment-approach` | Do you have a specific medication in mind? | Single select (No/Yes) | Routing |
| 4 | `/lose-14-pounds` | "Lose 14.3 lbs in 2 months" graph | Results teaser | Conversion push |
| 5 | `/see-their-progress` | Before/after customer photos | Social proof carousel | Conversion push |
| 6 | `/select-state` | Select your state + Terms/Telehealth consent | Dropdown + checkbox | Legal/eligibility |
| 7 | `/date-of-birth` | Date of birth | Input | Eligibility |
| 8 | `/eating-pattern-goal` | What would reaching goal weight mean for you? (select all) | Multi-select (energy, confidence, health, body, clothes) | Emotional hook |

### Phase 2: Medical Intake (Post-Account) — ~15+ steps
After account creation (`hims.com/c/wm/`), it shifts to real medical intake with a progress bar:

| # | URL slug | Question | Type |
|---|----------|----------|------|
| 1 | `/intake-up-next` | "Up next: Health history" stepper (Weight loss profile > Health history > Treatment preview) | Progress overview |
| 2 | `/intake-height-weight` | Height & weight | Inputs |
| 3 | `/intake-weight-loss-goal` | Goal weight | Input |
| 4 | `/how-medication-can-help` | BMI calculation + qualification result | Personalized results |
| 5 | `/medical-intake?offset=1` | Ethnicity | Multi-select |
| 6 | `offset=2` | Sex assigned at birth | Single select |
| 7 | `offset=3` | Do you identify as a man? | Single select |
| 8 | `offset=4` | Gender identity | Single select |
| 9 | `offset=6` | Daily activity level (1-5 scale) | Single select |
| 10 | `offset=8` | Eating disorder symptoms screening | Multi-select |
| 11 | `offset=9` | Mental health condition? | Yes/No |
| 12 | `offset=10` | Specific mental health diagnoses | Multi-select |
| 13 | `offset=11` | Active psychiatric care? | Yes/No |
| 14 | `offset=12` | Stable in treatment? | Yes/No |
| 15 | `offset=13` | Taking mental health meds? | Yes/No |
| 16 | `offset=14` | Self-harm screening | Yes/No |
| 17 | `offset=16` | GI conditions (IBS, Celiac, etc.) | Multi-select |
| 18 | `offset=17` | Medical conditions / chronic diseases? | Yes/No |
| 19 | `offset=18` | Kidney conditions history | Multi-select |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Two-phase design** — Phase 1 is pure marketing/engagement (light, emotional, social proof). Phase 2 is real medical intake (heavy, clinical). Account creation is the gate between them.

2. **Category-level, not product-level** — This is "weight management" broadly, not a specific drug quiz. The quiz asks "do you have a specific medication in mind?" early on, suggesting it can branch.

3. **~7 easy questions before asking for an account** — They hook you with personalized results (BMI, weight loss projections) before requiring signup. Smart conversion tactic.

4. **The marketing questions are emotional** — "What would reaching your goal weight mean to you?" is not medical, it's psychological buy-in.

5. **Medical intake is exhaustive** — 15+ questions covering mental health, GI conditions, kidney issues, eating disorders. This is real clinical screening, not fluff.

6. **Interstitial "sell" screens** — Social proof (before/afters), stat callouts (83% stat), results projections (14.3 lbs graph) are mixed in between questions to keep engagement up.

## Entry 2 — Maximus Tribe Growth Hormone Quiz Flow Analysis

**It's PRODUCT-SPECIFIC** — this is the sermorelin/growth hormone flow specifically, living on `app.maximustribe.com`. Much shorter and tighter than Hims.

### Full Flow — 12 steps total

| # | URL slug | Screen | Type | Purpose |
|---|----------|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | `/growth-hormone-start` | Product landing — Injectable Sermorelin vial, "Recover faster, feel younger", value props, "Find my protocol" CTA | Landing/sell | Entry point |
| 2 | `/hero_guest_onboarding/hero_goals` | What are your goals? (muscle gain, energy, mental, sexual, sleep, weight loss, anti-aging) | Multi-select | Segmentation + emotional buy-in |
| 3 | `/hero_guest_onboarding/proven_results` | "Proven ingredients. Proven results." — Fast acting 1-4 wks, Continued improvement 3-6 mo | Interstitial/sell | Conversion push |
| 4 | `/hero_guest_onboarding/state` | What state are you located in? | Dropdown | Eligibility |
| 5 | `/hero_guest_onboarding/sex` | What sex were you assigned at birth? | Single select (Male/Female) | Medical screening |
| 6 | `/hero_guest_onboarding/cancer_diagnosis` | Have you been diagnosed with cancer? | Single select (4 options with timing/status) | Contraindication screen |
| 7 | `/hero_guest_onboarding/cancer_diagnosis_relative_new` | Family cancer history? | Single select (3 options) | Contraindication screen |
| 8 | `/hero_guest_onboarding/recent_medical_care` | Recent medical care regarding cancer? | Single select (3 options) | Contraindication screen |
| 9 | `/hero_guest_onboarding/unexplained_symptoms` | Unexplained symptoms? (lumps, bleeding, weight loss, persistent pain) | Multi-select | Contraindication screen |
| 10 | `/hero_guest_onboarding/rooted_science` | "Rooted in science" — Dr. Cam Sepah (CEO) photo + bio | Interstitial/sell | Trust/authority |
| 11 | `/hero_guest_onboarding/set_up_account` | Create account (Google or email) | Account creation | Gate |
| 12 | `/hero_guest_onboarding/multimonth_plan_selection` | Choose Your Plan — 6mo ($87/first), 3mo ($149/first), Monthly ($224) | Plan selection | Checkout |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Product-specific, not category** — Entry point is a sermorelin product landing page. Whole quiz is tailored to growth hormone treatment.

2. **Only ~8 real questions before account creation** — Much leaner than Hims. Gets you to signup fast.

3. **Cancer screening is dominant** — 4 of 8 questions are about cancer history. Sermorelin stimulates growth hormone, which is contraindicated with active cancer. Product-specific medical screening.

4. **Two interstitial sell screens** — "Proven results" (timeline) and "Rooted in science" (founder/CEO). Less social proof than Hims, more authority-based.

5. **Plan selection comes AFTER account creation** — Pricing ($87-$224/mo) gated behind signup.

6. **All on subdomain** — Entire flow lives on `app.maximustribe.com`, separate from marketing site.

7. **No height/weight/BMI** — Not needed for growth hormone (unlike Hims weight loss flow).

### Hims vs Maximus Comparison

| | Hims (Weight Mgmt) | Maximus (Growth Hormone) |
|---|---|---|
| Quiz type | Category-level | Product-specific |
| Pre-account questions | ~7 | ~8 |
| Post-account questions | 15+ | 0 (straight to plan selection) |
| Total steps | 25+ | 12 |
| Sell interstitials | 3 (stat, graph, before/afters) | 2 (results timeline, founder bio) |
| Medical depth | Deep (mental health, GI, kidney, eating disorders) | Focused (cancer screening only) |
| Account gate placement | Mid-flow | Near end |
| Pricing visibility | After account + full intake | After account only |

## Entry 3 — Eden (tryeden.com) Sermorelin Quiz Flow Analysis

**Product-specific flow** for sermorelin, on `app.tryeden.com`. The most conversion-optimized of the three — recommends the specific product AND lets you pick supply duration before checkout.

### Full Flow — ~16 steps

| # | Screen | Type | Purpose |
|---|--------|------|---------|
| 1 | **Product page** — Sermorelin Injection, $126/first month then $176/mo, "See if you qualify" CTA, Benefits/Pricing/Description tabs, related product (Sermorelin ODT), Trustpilot badge | Product page | Entry point |
| 2 | **Health goals** — "Tell us about your health goals" (select all: muscle tone, body composition, metabolic health, cardiovascular health, energy, recovery, sleep, skin & hair) | Multi-select | Segmentation |
| 3 | **Cardiovascular self-assessment** — 5 levels from struggle to top shape | Single select | Health baseline |
| 4 | **Strength self-assessment** — 5 levels from struggle to well-developed | Single select | Health baseline |
| 5 | **Sermorelin education** — "Building muscle isn't just about hitting the gym..." explains GH role | Interstitial/sell | Education + buy-in |
| 6 | **Energy levels** — 4 levels from consistently low to excellent | Single select | Health baseline |
| 7 | **Sermorelin recommendation** — "Sermorelin can be a highly effective approach to everything you've answered so far" | Interstitial/sell | Personalized pitch |
| 8 | **Transition to medical** — "Next, we're going to ask about your health, medical history, and lifestyle" | Interstitial | Phase transition |
| 9 | **Account gate** — Email login or create account (email, name, password, terms/telehealth consent) | Account creation | Gate |
| 10 | **Date of birth** | Input | Eligibility |
| 11 | **Sex assigned at birth** — Male/Female | Single select | Medical |
| 12 | **Phone + Zip + SMS consent** — Phone, zip code, SMS opt-in for care updates + marketing | Inputs + consent | Contact + legal |
| 13 | **Product recommendation** — "Based on your answers, you may be eligible for..." — Sermorelin 2mg/mL Injection ($246) or Sermorelin 500mcg Sublingual Tablet ($196) | Product selection | Recommendation |
| 14 | **Supply option** — 1-month ($246), 3-month ($588), 6-month ($1,056 was $1,476) | Plan selection | Pricing |
| 15 | **Shipping address** — Doctor video mockup ("Dr. Maya"), "What to expect" (free shipping, free medical review, free ongoing support), address form | Checkout | Shipping |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Starts on actual product page** — Full product page with pricing, benefits tabs, Trustpilot. CTA is "See if you qualify" — qualification framing.

2. **Self-assessment style questions** — Rate your cardiovascular health, strength, energy on a spectrum. Feels like a wellness assessment, not a medical intake.

3. **Minimal medical screening** — No cancer questions, no mental health, no condition checklists. Just DOB, sex, phone/zip. Way lighter clinically than Hims and Maximus.

4. **Two personalized sell interstitials** — One educational, one tying sermorelin directly to your answers ("highly effective approach to everything you've answered so far").

5. **Account creation mid-flow** — Gate after marketing questions, before medical/demographic questions. Similar to Hims.

6. **Product RECOMMENDATION at the end** — "Based on your answers, you may be eligible for..." shows Injectable ($246) AND Sublingual Tablet ($196). The quiz actually routes to the right product.

7. **Pricing visible throughout** — Product page shows pricing upfront, recommendation shows prices, supply selection shows prices. No hiding.

8. **SMS consent built in** — Phone + zip + SMS opt-in baked into flow. Smart for remarketing.

9. **Doctor mockup at checkout** — Video call style "Dr. Maya" image adds clinical legitimacy at final step.

### Three-Way Comparison

| | Hims (Weight Mgmt) | Maximus (Growth Hormone) | Eden (Sermorelin) |

| Pricing visibility | Hidden | After account | Throughout |

## Entry 4 — Quiz Strategy: Grouping, What to Copy, What to Change

### Quiz Grouping (5 quizzes)

| Quiz | Products | Type | Recommendation? |
|------|----------|------|-----------------|
| **Hair Loss** | Oral Finasteride, Oral Dutasteride, Topical Finasteride, Topical Dutasteride | Category quiz | Yes — oral vs topical, fin vs dut |
| **Sermorelin** | Injectable Sermorelin, Oral Sermorelin | Product-family quiz | Yes — injectable vs oral |
| **NAD+** | NAD+ Injection | Single product | No — qualification + engagement only |
| **ED** | 4-in-1 ED Rapid Dissolve | Single product | No — qualification + engagement only |
| **Testosterone** | Enclomiphene | Single product | No — qualification + engagement only |

### What to Copy from Competitors

- One question per screen, clean layout, progress bar
- Goals question first (emotional buy-in before anything medical)
- Interstitial sell screens between questions — personalized pitch based on answers
- Account gate mid-flow — marketing questions first, gate, then medical/checkout
- "Based on your answers" recommendation page (for multi-product quizzes)
- SMS collection built into flow

### What to Do Differently

- **Keep it short** — 8-12 steps max per quiz (Maximus length, not Hims)
- **Skip deep medical screening** — that belongs in the provider intake on checkout.unbrandedrx.co, not a marketing quiz
- **Show pricing early** — our prices are our advantage ($119/mo sermorelin vs Eden's $246). Don't hide them
- **Quiz lives on main site** — not a subdomain. Routes: `/quiz/hair-loss`, `/quiz/sermorelin`, etc.
- **No cancer screening in the quiz** — leave that for the prescribing provider
- **Show recommendation before requiring account** — let them see what they'd get before asking for signup

### Flow Templates

**Multi-product quizzes** (Hair Loss, Sermorelin) — ~10 steps:
1. Goals (multi-select)
2. Self-assessment question 1
3. Self-assessment question 2
4. Sell interstitial (personalized to answers)

## Entry 5 — Quiz Question Drafts (All 5 Quizzes)

---

### Quiz 1: Hair Loss (`/quiz/hair-loss`)

**Recommends:** Oral Finasteride, Oral Dutasteride, Topical Finasteride, or Topical Dutasteride

**Step 1 — Goals (multi-select)**
> What are your hair goals?

- Stop further hair loss
- Regrow hair in thinning areas
- Thicken existing hair
- Maintain a treatment I've already started
- Preventive — I'm noticing early signs

**Step 2 — Hair loss pattern**
> How would you describe your current hair loss?

- Receding hairline
- Thinning at the crown
- Overall thinning across the top

- Yes, oral medication (finasteride, dutasteride, etc.)
- Yes, topical treatment (minoxidil, topical fin, etc.)
- Yes, both oral and topical
- No, this would be my first treatment

**Step 4 — Sell interstitial**
> Prescription treatments don't just slow hair loss — they target the root cause.

> DHT is the hormone responsible for shrinking your hair follicles. Finasteride and dutasteride block DHT production, giving your follicles the chance to recover and regrow.

**Step 5 — Delivery preference (key routing question)**
> Do you have a preference for how you take your treatment?

- Oral — a daily pill, simple and easy
- Topical — applied directly to the scalp
- No preference — recommend what's best for me

**Step 6 — Strength preference (key routing question)**
> How aggressive do you want your treatment to be?

- Standard — proven and well-tolerated (→ finasteride)
- Maximum strength — strongest available option (→ dutasteride)
- Not sure — let the provider decide

**Step 7 — State**
> What state do you live in?

*Dropdown — for prescribing eligibility*

**Step 8 — DOB**
> When were you born?

*Date input*

**Step 9 — Sex**

- Male
- Female

**Step 10 — Recommendation**
> Based on your answers, here's what we recommend:

*Logic:*
- Oral + Standard → **Oral Finasteride**
- Oral + Maximum → **Oral Dutasteride**
- Topical + Standard → **Topical Finasteride**
- Topical + Maximum → **Topical Dutasteride**
- No preference → Default to **Oral Finasteride** (most popular) with alternatives shown

- Quickly — I bounce back fast
- I don't exercise regularly enough to say

**Step 4 — Sell interstitial**
> Your body's natural growth hormone is a key driver of muscle development, recovery, and overall vitality — but levels decline with age.

> Sermorelin works by stimulating your body's own growth hormone production, giving you the foundation to build lean muscle, recover faster, sleep deeper, and perform at your best.

**Step 5 — Delivery preference (key routing question)**

*Logic:*

- No — I've never been tested

**Step 4 — Sell interstitial**
