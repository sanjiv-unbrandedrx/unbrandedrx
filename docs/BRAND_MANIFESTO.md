# UnbrandedRx Brand Manifesto v1

## The Core Idea

**"The product is the brand."**

UnbrandedRx exists for men who care about results, not marketing. We strip away the lifestyle imagery, the aspirational messaging, and the premium branding—leaving only what matters: effective treatments at fair prices.

---

## Target Market

- **Primary audience:** Men (85% of customers)
- **Age range:** 30-55+
- **Mindset:** Price-conscious, results-oriented, skeptical of marketing fluff
- **Search behavior:** "generic dutasteride", "cheap tadalafil online", "enclomiphene cost"

---

## Brand Positioning

### What We Are
- Direct, no-frills access to proven treatments
- Same formulations as premium brands, without the markup
- Physician-supervised telehealth done efficiently
- Generic positioning = lower CAC, honest value prop

### What We're NOT
- Lower quality (same exact formulations)
- Worse service (same fulfillment infrastructure)
- Unsupported (still physician-supervised, real customer service)

---

## Visual Identity

### Inspiration
- **The Ordinary** (https://theordinary.com) - clinical, ingredient-forward, anti-marketing marketing
- Pharmaceutical minimalism
- Scientific clarity over lifestyle aspiration

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** White, off-white, light gray
- **Accents:** Sage green, soft neutrals
- **Backgrounds:** Gradient washes (sage, blush, warm gray)
- **Text:** Near-black (#171717), muted foreground for secondary

## Imagery & Photography: The Product is the Hero

### THE #1 RULE
**Strictly Prohibited:** No lifestyle photos. No smiling models, no couples on the beach, no guys looking in the mirror. Ever.

### Primary Imagery Types

#### 1. Clinical Product Shots
- Pills shot in macro, arranged neatly
- Plain white or gray backgrounds
- Clean, sharp, perfectly lit
- Studio lighting with soft shadows

#### 2. Packaging Shots
- The simple, clean bottle or box is the hero
- Matte white HDPE containers
- No labels or minimal labeling
- Floating/levitating compositions add lightness

#### 3. Hand + Product
- Elegant hands holding pills or bottles
- Neutral nail colors, well-groomed
- Isolated on pure white or colored backgrounds
- Focus on the product, not the person

#### 4. Abstract/Architectural
- Clean, minimalist architecture
- Light and shadow play
- Textures that convey order, structure, science
- Geometric compositions

### Photography Specifications
- **Camera:** Canon EOS R5 or equivalent (for prompt reference)
- **Lens:** 50mm or macro lens
- **Lighting:** Soft, diffused studio lighting
- **Style:** High resolution, high detail, crisp focus
- **Post:** Pastel color grading, smooth gradients

Soft, diffused studio lighting highlights the clean texture of the HDPE plastic, casting a faint shadow beneath for depth. The composition is minimal and balanced, with the jar gently tilted to add a sense of motion and lightness.

## Tone of Voice

### Writing Style
- **Direct:** Say what it does. Skip the poetry.
- **Clinical:** Use proper medical terminology, explain it simply
- **Confident:** We know these treatments work
- **Transparent:** Real pricing, real expectations, real timelines

### Examples

**DON'T say:**
> "Unlock your full potential and become the man you were meant to be."

**DO say:**
> "Enclomiphene: 1.5-2x testosterone increase in 6-8 weeks. $79/month."

**DON'T say:**
> "Join thousands of men on their wellness journey."

**DO say:**
> "Same medication. Fair price. Ships free."
