# UnbrandedRx Product Photography Design Brief

## Project Overview

Create a comprehensive product photography library for UnbrandedRx, a men's telehealth pharmacy brand. Images will be generated without labels/logos, then branded assets will be composited in Figma.

**Designer Workflow:**
1. Generate/create blank product images (AI or photography)
2. Export as high-res PNGs
3. Add logo + text labels in Figma using brand assets
