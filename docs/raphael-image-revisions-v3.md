# Image Revisions for Raphael — Round 3

Hey Raphael,

Great progress on this round! The hero images, science images, product cards, hero background, and lab testing image all look fantastic — dimensions are spot on and the tighter crops are exactly what we needed. Those 14 files are locked in.

Just 6 files left to nail down — all the "How It Works" step images. They're still coming in at the wrong dimensions. Here's the breakdown:

## Home Page — How It Works (3 files)

These are wide, landscape-oriented banner images. They came in at 560x400, but they need to be **640x240** — much wider and shorter (almost a 2.7:1 ratio, like a thin banner strip).

| File | You Delivered | Correct Size |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `how-it-works-step-1.png` | 560x400 | **640x240** |
| `how-it-works-step-2.png` | 560x400 | **640x240** |
| `how-it-works-step-3.png` | 560x400 | **640x240** |

## Shared (Product Pages) — How It Works (3 files)

This is the tricky part — these three each have a **different, unique aspect ratio**. They're NOT all the same size. Last round they all came in at 1120x800, and this round they're the same 1120x800 again.

| File | You Delivered | Correct Size | Shape |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| `how-it-works-step-1.png` | 1120x800 | **370x404** | Nearly square, slightly portrait |
| `how-it-works-step-2.png` | 1120x800 | **404x506** | Portrait (taller than wide) |
| `how-it-works-step-3.png` | 1120x800 | **380x240** | Landscape (wider than tall) |

The artwork itself looks great — the line art style is perfect. They just need to be re-exported at these exact pixel dimensions. Each one is a different shape because they sit in different layout positions on the product pages.

Everything else is good to go — just these 6 and we're done. Thanks!
