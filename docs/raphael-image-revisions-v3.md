# Image Revisions for Raphael — Round 3

Hey Raphael,

Great progress on this round! The hero images, science images, product cards, hero background, and lab testing image all look fantastic — dimensions are spot on and the tighter crops are exactly what we needed. Those 14 files are locked in.

Just 6 files left to nail down — all the "How It Works" step images. They're still coming in at the wrong dimensions. Here's the breakdown:

## Home Page — How It Works (3 files)

These are wide, landscape-oriented banner images. They came in at 560x400, but they need to be **640x240** — much wider and shorter (almost a 2.7:1 ratio, like a thin banner strip).

| File | You Delivered | Correct Size |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `how-it-works-step-1.png` | 560x400 | **640x240** |
| `how-it-works-step-2.png` | 560x400 | **640x240** |
| `how-it-works-step-3.png` | 560x400 | **640x240** |

## ~~Shared (Product Pages) — How It Works (3 files)~~ RESOLVED

Updated the code to use these images as full card backgrounds instead of small floating elements. The 1120x800 dimensions work as-is — no re-export needed. The line art fills the card as a subtle background with text overlaid on top.

| File | Dimensions | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| `how-it-works-step-1.png` | 1120x800 | **Good to go** |
| `how-it-works-step-2.png` | 1120x800 | **Good to go** |
| `how-it-works-step-3.png` | 1120x800 | **Good to go** |

You can see how they render live here (scroll down to the "How It Works" section on any product page):

Only the 3 home page "How It Works" banner images still need the dimension fix. Thanks!
