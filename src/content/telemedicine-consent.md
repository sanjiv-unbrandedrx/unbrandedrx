### **UnbrandedRx - Telemedicine Consent**

**Last Updated: January 13, 2026**

## Consent to Telehealth Services

By using the UnbrandedRx platform and services, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms regarding telemedicine/telehealth services provided by Titan Medical Group and its affiliated healthcare providers.

## What is Telehealth?

Telehealth involves the use of electronic communications, information technology, and telecommunications technologies to enable healthcare providers at different locations to share individual patient medical information for the purpose of providing clinical care, diagnosis, consultation, treatment, therapy, and education.

The telehealth services available through UnbrandedRx may include:
- Asynchronous (store-and-forward) consultations using secure messaging and questionnaires
- Synchronous (real-time) video consultations with healthcare providers
- Remote monitoring and follow-up care
- Electronic prescription services
- Medical advice and health education

## Expected Benefits of Telehealth

The use of telehealth services can provide a number of benefits, including but not limited to:
- **Improved Access to Care**: Receive medical consultations from the comfort of your home
- **Convenience**: Eliminate travel time and waiting rooms
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined evaluation and management of your health conditions
- **Continuity of Care**: Easier follow-up and ongoing monitoring
- **Access to Specialists**: Connect with qualified healthcare providers regardless of geographic location

## Possible Risks and Limitations of Telehealth

While telehealth services offer many advantages, you should be aware of the following potential risks and limitations:

- **Technology Failures**: Equipment, internet connection, or software failures could cause delays in evaluation or treatment
- **Quality Limitations**: Transmission quality (video, image, or audio) may be inadequate for proper medical decision-making, which may require rescheduling or in-person follow-up
- **Incomplete Information**: The healthcare provider will not have access to your complete medical history unless you provide it or authorize records transfer, which may result in adverse drug interactions, allergic reactions, or other medical errors
- **Security Risks**: Despite security protocols, there is a rare possibility of privacy breach or unauthorized access to your protected health information
- **Diagnostic Limitations**: Physical examination limitations may affect the provider's ability to diagnose certain conditions
- **Emergency Situations**: Telehealth is not appropriate for emergency medical conditions

## Your Rights and Responsibilities

### As a Patient, You Have the Right To:

1. **Choose Your Provider**: Review the credentials and qualifications of the healthcare provider who will be providing your telehealth services
2. **Privacy Protection**: Expect that all medical information shared during telehealth consultations will be kept confidential and protected under federal and state privacy laws, including HIPAA
3. **Informed Consent**: Ask questions about the telehealth services, how they work, and what to expect
4. **Withdraw Consent**: Withdraw your consent to telehealth services at any time without affecting your right to future care or treatment, or risking the loss or withdrawal of any program benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled
5. **Alternative Options**: Be informed of alternative treatment options, including in-person consultations
6. **Access Your Records**: Request copies of your medical records in accordance with applicable laws

### As a Patient, You Are Responsible For:

1. **Accurate Information**: Providing complete and accurate medical history, current medications, allergies, and other health information
2. **Honest Communication**: Answering all questions truthfully and completely
3. **Compliance**: Following the treatment plan prescribed by your healthcare provider
4. **Environment**: Ensuring you are in a private, quiet location during video consultations
5. **Technical Requirements**: Having the necessary technology (smartphone, computer, internet connection) to participate in telehealth services
6. **Emergency Situations**: Understanding when to seek emergency care instead of using telehealth services
