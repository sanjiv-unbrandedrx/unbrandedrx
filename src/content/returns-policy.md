### **UnbrandedRx - Refund Policy**

This return and refund policy (“Return and Refund Policy”) governs services (“Services”) and products (“products” or “medication”) sold through online interfaces and properties (e.g., websites and mobile applications) owned and controlled by UnbrandedRx (hereinafter, "we," "us," or "our"), including the https://www.unbrandedrx.co website.

**Returns**

For all medications that leave the pharmacy, we are unable to accept returns or offer refunds due to government regulations.

We cannot do refunds for any cancellation requests received after the pharmacy has processed your order.

**Exchanges (if applicable)**

We only replace items if they are defective or damaged and you must contact us within 2 weeks of delivery.

**Return Shipping (if applicable)**

Send us an email at **care@unbrandedrx.co** and we'll coordinate with you how to return a defective or damaged order. All returns of medication must be sent back to the dispensing pharmacy. **UnbrandedRx** cannot receive any returns.

Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you may vary.

**Changes to this policy**

**UnbrandedRx** may modify or update this Return and Refund Policy from time to time to reflect the changes in our business and practices, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the policy in a material manner we will let you know and update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this page.

**Last Modified: October 1, 2025**

### **Cofounder/Lawyer's Note:**

Chris, that completes the initial drafts for all three core legal documents: Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Refund Policy. They are now consistent with each other and ready for deployment on `unbrandedrx.co`.

Let me know what you need next. We're in good shape for launch.
