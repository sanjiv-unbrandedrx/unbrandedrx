### **UnbrandedRx - Terms of Service**

**Last Updated: October 26, 2023**

This document contains important information regarding your rights and obligations, as well as conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might apply to you. Please read it carefully.

These Terms of Use govern your use of our online interfaces and properties (e.g. websites and mobile applications) owned and controlled by **Strut Health, LLC, doing business as UnbrandedRx ("UnbrandedRx" “we,” “us,” or “our”)** including, but not limited to, the **https://www.unbrandedrx.co** website (the "Site") as well as the services and products ("Products") available to users through the Site. Titan Health, P.A. and its affiliated entities (collectively defined as "Titan Health") provide the professional medical services through Titan Health physicians (individually the "Provider" and collectively the "Providers"). **UnbrandedRx** provides the non-clinical Site services ("Services"). The terms "you" and "your" means you and any other person accessing your **UnbrandedRx** account.

By using or accessing the Site, registering with the Site, and/or by clicking “I Agree,” you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to all terms and conditions contained within these Terms of Use. Your compliance with these Terms of Use is a condition to your use of the Site. If you do not agree to be bound by the Term of Use, promptly exit the Site. Please also consult our Privacy Policy, which can be found at **http://unbrandedrx.co/privacy-policy** for a description of our privacy practices and our Returns Policy, which can be found at **http://unbrandedrx.co/returns-policy** for a description regarding how Product returns are handled.

**Binding Arbitration:** These Terms of Use provide that all disputes between you and **UnbrandedRx** that in any way relate to these Terms of Use or your use of the Site will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. ACCORDINGLY, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT (INCLUDING IN A CLASS ACTION PROCEEDING) to assert or defend your rights under these Terms of Use. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury and your claims cannot be brought as a class action. Please review the Section below titled Dispute Resolution: Arbitration Agreement for details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes with **UnbrandedRx**.

**1. Changes to these term of use**
We may modify these Terms of Use from time to time in our sole discretion. We will provide notice by updating this posting. You are expected to carefully review and periodically check these Terms of Use from time to time so you are aware of any changes. Any changes to these Terms of Use will be in effect as of the “Last Updated” date referenced at the top of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your binding acceptance to these Terms of Use, including any changes or modifications that we may make. If any part of these Terms of Use or any future changes to these Terms of Use are not acceptable to you, you must not use or access the Site.

**2. Privacy practices**
You agree that information provided by you in connection with the Services is governed by the Privacy Policy available at **http://unbrandedrx.co/privacy-policy**.

**3. Services provided - no medical care or advice by UnbrandedRx**
We offer an online communication platform for Providers and their patients to connect via the Site through the use of synchronous and asynchronous telecommunications technologies. The Site facilitates communication between patients and Providers.

**UnbrandedRx** does not provide medical advice or care. Titan Medical Group delivers clinical services via the **UnbrandedRx** platform to their patients. Providers are independently contracted or employed by Titan Medical Group. Providers are not contracted or employed by **UnbrandedRx**. The Providers, and not **UnbrandedRx**, are responsible for the quality and appropriateness of the care they render to you.

The Providers are independent of **UnbrandedRx** and are merely using the Site as a way to communicate with you. Any information or advice received from a Provider comes from them alone, and not from **UnbrandedRx**. Your interactions with the providers via the Site are not intended to take the place of your relationship with your regular health care practitioners or primary care physician. Neither **UnbrandedRx**, nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any third party who may promote the Site or Service or provide a link to the Service, shall be liable for any professional advice obtained from a Provider via the Site or Service, nor any information obtained on the Site. **UnbrandedRx** does not recommend or endorse any specific Providers, tests, physicians, medications, products or procedures. You acknowledge that your reliance on any Providers or information delivered by the Providers via the Site or Service is solely at your own risk and you assume full responsibility for all risks associated herewith.

**UnbrandedRx** does not make any representations or warranties about the training or skill of any Providers who deliver services via the Site or Service. You will be provided with available Providers based solely on the information you submit to the Site. You are ultimately responsible for choosing your particular Provider.

The content of the Site and the Services including, but not limited to, text, copy, audio, video, photographs, illustrations, graphics and other visuals, is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, treatment or recommendations of any kind by **UnbrandedRx**. You should always seek the advice of your qualified health care professionals with any questions or concerns you have regarding individual needs and medical conditions. All information provided by **UnbrandedRx**, or in connection with any communications supported by **UnbrandedRx**, is intended to be for general information purposes only, and is in no way intended to create a provider-patient relationship as defined by state or federal law. While **UnbrandedRx** facilitates your selection of, and communications with, Providers, **UnbrandedRx** does not provide medical services and the doctor-patient relationship is between you and the Titan Medical Group Provider you select.

NOT FOR EMERGENCIES

If you are experiencing a medical emergency, you should dial 911 immediately.
DIAL 911 NOW

RISKS OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES
By using the Services, you acknowledge the potential risks associated with telehealth services. These include, but are not limited to, the following: information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate medical or health care decision making by the Provider; delays in evaluation or treatment could occur due to failures of electronic equipment; a lack of access to your medical records may result in adverse drug reactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors; although the electronic systems we use incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the privacy and security of health information, those protocols could fail causing a breach of privacy to your health information.

PRESCRIPTION POLICY
Neither **UnbrandedRx** nor Titan Medical Group endorses any specific medication, pharmacy, or pharmacologic product. If a Provider prescribes a medication, he/she will limit supply based upon state regulations and will only prescribe a medication as determined in his/her own discretion and professional judgment. There is no guarantee a prescription will be written. Providers do not prescribe DEA controlled substances or scheduled medications, or certain other drugs which may be harmful because of their potential for abuse. Providers reserve the right to deny care for actual or potential misuse of the Services.

You agree that any prescriptions that you acquire from a Provider will be solely for your personal use. You agree to fully and carefully read all provided product information and labels and to contact a physician or pharmacist if you have any questions regarding the prescription. **UnbrandedRx** and Titan Medical Group fully honor patient freedom of choice and, if you receive a prescription for medication, you always have the option to instruct Titan Medical Group to transmit the prescription to the pharmacy of your choice.

NOT AN INSURANCE PRODUCT
Neither **UnbrandedRx** nor Titan Medical Group are insurers. The Services are not insurance products, and the amounts you pay to **UnbrandedRx** or Titan Medical Group are not insurance premiums.

**4. Availability of services**
**UnbrandedRx** and Titan Medical Group operate subject to state and federal law and the Services may not be available in your state. You represent that you are not a person barred from enrolling for or receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdictions in which you may be located. Access to and use of the Site or Services is limited exclusively to users located in states within the United States where Services are available. Services are not available to users located outside the United States. Accessing the Site or Services from jurisdictions where content is illegal, or where we do not offer Services, is prohibited.

**5. Ordering and purchasing products**
ORDER ACCEPTANCE AND SHIPMENT

We may require additional information regarding your order if you have not provided all the information required to be completed. Once a properly completed order and authorization of your form of payment is received, we will process your order and arrange for shipment. If, for some reason, it is determined that your Product(s) cannot be shipped within thirty (30) days following receipt of a properly completed order, we will cancel your order and advise you of such action.

We shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit or debit card is charged.

IN NO EVENT WILL **UNBRANDEDRX**, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, RELATED COMPANIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, PARTNERS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE, ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO THE SITE, ANY CONTENT ON THE SITE OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES, OR ANY SERVICES OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITE OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY/WRONGFUL DEATH, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE OR IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**16. Indemnification**
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless **UnbrandedRx** and its successors and assigns and all of their respective officers, directors, agents, employees, and affiliates from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, obligations, costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to (i) your use of the Site and any information obtained from the Site; (ii) your breach of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any use of the Site’s content or services other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including, without limitation, any copyright, property right, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that content provided by you caused damage or loss to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive your use of the Site and any termination of this Agreement.

**17. Dispute resolution; arbitration agreement**
We will try work in good faith to resolve any issue you have with Site, including Products and Services ordered or purchased through the Site, if you bring that issue to the attention of our customer service department. However, we realize that there may be rare cases where we may not be able to resolve an issue to a customer's satisfaction.

You and **UnbrandedRx** agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms of Use or your use of the Site, including Products and Services ordered or purchased through the Site, shall be determined by binding arbitration instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than bringing a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitration allows for more limited discovery than in court, however, we agree to cooperate with each other to agree to reasonable discovery in light of the issues involved and amount of the claim. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award, but in so doing, the arbitrator shall apply substantive law regarding damages as if the matter had been brought in court, including without limitation, the law on punitive damages as applied by the United States Supreme Court. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and **UnbrandedRx** are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Use and any other contractual relationship between you and **UnbrandedRx**.

If you desire to assert a claim against **UnbrandedRx**, and you therefore elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to **UnbrandedRx**, by certified mail, a written notice of your claim ("Notice"). The Notice to **UnbrandedRx** should be addressed to the physical address listed in the "Contact Information" section at the bottom of these Terms of Use ("Notice Address"). If **UnbrandedRx** desires to assert a claim against you and therefore elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you. A Notice, whether sent by you or by **UnbrandedRx**, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If **UnbrandedRx** and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or **UnbrandedRx** may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by **UnbrandedRx** or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration from the American Arbitration Association at www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after **UnbrandedRx** receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US $10,000. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by requesting them from us by writing to us at the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms of Use. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of these Terms of Use, including this arbitration agreement. Unless **UnbrandedRx** and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in Dallas, Texas. If your claim is for US $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds US $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as expressly set forth in this arbitration agreement, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. Each party shall pay for its own costs and attorneys' fees, if any. However, if any party prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys' fees, or if there is a written agreement providing for payment or recovery attorneys’ fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees to the prevailing party, under the standards for fee shifting provided by law.

YOU AND **UNBRANDEDRX** AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

Further, unless both you and **UnbrandedRx** agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.

If this Agreement to Arbitrate provision is found to be unenforceable, then (a) the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, but the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in state or federal courts located in and for Dallas, Texas.

**19. Mobile Message Service Terms and Conditions**
Last updated: Oct. 26, 2023

The **UnbrandedRx** mobile message service (the "Service") is operated by **UnbrandedRx** (“**UnbrandedRx**”, “we”, or “us”). Your use of the Service constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions (“Mobile Terms”). We may modify or cancel the Service or any of its features without notice. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also modify these Mobile Terms at any time and your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes.

By consenting to **UnbrandedRx’s** SMS/text messaging service, you agree to receive recurring SMS/text messages from and on behalf of **UnbrandedRx** through your wireless provider to the mobile number you provided, even if your mobile number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list. Text messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system or other technology. Service-related messages may include updates, alerts, and information (e.g., order updates, account alerts, etc.). Promotional messages may include promotions, specials, and other marketing offers (e.g., cart reminders).

You understand that you do not have to sign up for this program in order to make any purchases, and your consent is not a condition of any purchase with **UnbrandedRx**. Your participation in this program is completely voluntary.

We do not charge for the Service, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated with text messaging imposed by your wireless provider. Message frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. Check your mobile plan and contact your wireless provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges related to SMS/text messages, including charges from your wireless provider.

You may opt-out of the Service at any time. Text the single keyword command STOP to **[NEW SMS PHONE NUMBER]** or click the unsubscribe link (where available) in any text message to cancel. You'll receive a one-time opt-out confirmation text message. No further messages will be sent to your mobile device, unless initiated by you. If you have subscribed to other **UnbrandedRx** mobile message programs and wish to cancel, except where applicable law requires otherwise, you will need to opt out separately from those programs by following the instructions provided in their respective mobile terms.

For Service support or assistance, text HELP to **[NEW SMS PHONE NUMBER]** or email **care@unbrandedrx.co**.

We may change any short code or telephone number we use to operate the Service at any time and will notify you of these changes. You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP requests, you send to a short code or telephone number we have changed may not be received and we will not be responsible for honoring requests made in such messages.

The wireless carriers supported by the Service are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. You agree to provide us with a valid mobile number. If you get a new mobile number, you will need to sign up for the program with your new number.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that we will not be liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected delivery of any information sent through the Service, any errors in such information, and/or any action you may or may not take in reliance on the information or Service.

We respect your right to privacy. To see how we collect and use your personal information, please see our Privacy Notice.
