          How Oral Finasteride Works
        </h3>
        <p className="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-3xl text-muted-foreground">
          Male pattern baldness is primarily caused by Dihydrotestosterone
          (DHT), a hormone that shrinks hair follicles, leading to thinning
          and eventual hair loss. Finasteride is an FDA-approved medication
          that works by blocking the enzyme (5-alpha reductase) that converts
          testosterone into DHT. By lowering DHT levels in the scalp,
          Finasteride helps to stop the progression of hair loss and can lead
          to regrowth in some men.
