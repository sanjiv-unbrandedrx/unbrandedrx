          Dutasteride vs. Finasteride: What&apos;s the Difference?
        </h3>
        <p className="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-3xl text-muted-foreground">
          Both Dutasteride and Finasteride are DHT-blockers used to treat
          male pattern baldness. However, Dutasteride is more potent because
          it inhibits more types of the 5-alpha reductase enzyme responsible
          for DHT production. For this reason, it is often considered for
          men whose hair loss is more advanced or who have not seen desired
          results with Finasteride. A licensed provider will help determine
          the right choice for you based on your medical history and hair
          loss pattern.
