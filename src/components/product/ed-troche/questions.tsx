                How do I use a troche?

                Place one troche under your tongue and allow it to dissolve
                completely. Do not chew or swallow it. This typically takes a
                few minutes. For best results, use 15-30 minutes before
                sexual activity.

                While it contains ingredients from the same class as Cialis速
                (Tadalafil) and Levitra速 (Vardenafil), our 4-in-1 formula also
                includes Apomorphine and Oxytocin to support arousal pathways
                in the brain. It&apos;s a more comprehensive approach in a
                fast-acting form.

                Are there any side effects?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent className="text-xs">
                Common side effects are similar to other ED medications and
                can include headache, flushing, or nasal congestion. It&apos;s
                crucial to discuss your full medical history and any
                medications you are taking with your provider. [Link to full

                Can I take it with food or alcohol?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent className="text-xs">
                Because it is absorbed under the tongue, the troche is less
                likely to be affected by food than some oral pills. However,
                heavy meals or excessive alcohol can still impact its
                effectiveness.

              <AccordionContent className="text-xs">
                Due to the Tadalafil component, the effects can last up to 36
                hours, but this does not mean you will have an erection for
                that entire time. It means the medication remains active in
                your system, facilitating an erection in response to sexual
                stimulation.
