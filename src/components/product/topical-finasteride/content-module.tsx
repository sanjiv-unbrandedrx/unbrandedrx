          Topical vs. Oral: Targeted Treatment
        </h3>
        <p className="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-3xl text-muted-foreground">
          Topical treatments deliver active ingredients directly to the hair
          follicles on the scalp. This localized approach is ideal for men
          who prefer not to take a daily pill or who want to minimize the
          potential for systemic side effects. Oral medications work from the
          inside out by altering hormone levels throughout the body. A
          provider can help you decide if a targeted topical approach is the
          best fit for your hair loss goals.
