TICKET: Evaluate HIPAA-Compliant Hosting Alternatives
Assigned to: Sanjiv
Priority: High
Date: 2026-02-23

CONTEXT:
We're currently on Vercel Hobby for unbrandedrx.co. HIPAA compliance
requires at minimum a Pro plan with a BAA. Upgrading to Pro added ~$350/mo
which is too expensive. We need a cheaper HIPAA-compliant hosting option
that still supports git-based deploys (commit to GitHub → auto build).

OPTIONS TO EVALUATE:
1. Vercel Pro — $350/mo, keeps current workflow, but expensive
2. AWS Amplify — BAA available under AWS, supports git-based deploys
3. Render — BAA on Team plan, git-based deploys
4. Self-hosted on AWS/GCP/Azure — cheapest long-term, more setup

REQUIREMENTS:
- HIPAA compliance with BAA
- Git-based deploy workflow (push to GitHub → auto build/deploy)
- Cheaper than $350/mo

ACTION:
Sanjiv to discuss with Vivek and decide on best path forward.
